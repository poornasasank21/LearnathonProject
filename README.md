In Enterprise Programming, We learned about how we could use the language of java to a different extent of context! unlike the simple java to which we have been exposed earlier this time in this course, we encountered the use of java in building front ends adding up how the front end tools like CSS, HTML, and XML could be used effectively for the building of a stable website and how we could use it to our help in connecting to the back end!

The Java language has its own powerful and significant importance in our modern-day technologies! we were able to witness some of the features that distinguish java from other computer languages like the concept of the servlet, JSP, JPA ..etc which are totally exclusive to java and let it stand out from the rest.

As a part of the course, we were given a project that would bring down the applications of different tools that have been taught! Our project as the name suggests is a typical website that acts as a platform where both student and recruiter could act upon their own needs and take the best possible advantage out of it!

This website that's been developed, has different Modules namely Student Module, Admin module, and Recruiter Module!

Each of which gathers the required data from all the Entities and gives the powers and responsibilities respectively! explicating, the admin has the access to the data that's been collected and has the power to develop the website at any given time, the recruiter has the power to add himself up in the portal and post openings at his firm, also mentioning the requirements that suit the opening and the most important one, the student has the role of giving his data, and apply for openings accords to if or whether his performances meet the criteria specified by the recruiter.

That's a glimpse of how the website works
